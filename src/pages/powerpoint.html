          <h2>See how our Spanish PowerPoint Lessons helped this teacher!</h2>
          <p>"Thank you so much for the Visual Link Spanish program. I am amazed by how much I have learned so
            quickly.
            I teach English as a second language. Right now all of my students speak Spanish. I can teach them
            English
            without knowing Spanish, but learning Spanish has helped me become a better teacher and friend to my
            students. Recently, I was helping the family of some of my students. I was in a situation where I was
            waiting with the mother, who spoke no English. She was very patient with me and I was able to
            understand
            most of what she said and express most of the things I wanted to say in Spanish. I am only on lesson
            10,
            but
            I will soon finish all of the lessons."</p>
